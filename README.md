# MIT 6.00 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming
Here is my repo for the problem sets done in MIT 6.00, every solution here is done in Python.
The files in this repository have been completed by Tyler Furby, with no collaboration.

## Course Description
This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their major, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Pythonâ„¢ programming language.
